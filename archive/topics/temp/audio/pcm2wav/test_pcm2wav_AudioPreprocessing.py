2. If playsound is installed on Python3, but ImportError occurs.
   
     $ python test_pcm2wav_AudioPreprocessing.py
     Traceback (most recent call last):
       File "test_pcm2wav_AudioPreprocessing.py", line 25, in <module>
         from playsound import playsound
     ImportError: No module named playsound
   Run it with the proper Python version that playsound is installed.
   Running with Python3 may fix the problem. Try python3, not python
   
     $ python3 test_pcm2wav_AudioPreprocessing.py

# Difference between test_pcm2wav_AudioPreprocessing.py and test_pcm2wav.py
#   In 'test_pcm2wav_AudioPreprocessing.py', pcm2wav is implemented as a method
#   of class AudioPreprocessing. The rest remains identical.

import wave
from playsound import playsound

# The parameters are prerequisite information. More specifically,
# channels, bit_depth, sampling_rate must be known to use this function.
