# Install Matplotlib
## On Anaconda
* Installing Matplotlib through [Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/) is recommended. 
  * Matplotlib is automatically installed when Anaconda is installed.
  * To install Anaconda, refer to [Installation in Anaconda Documentation](https://docs.anaconda.com/anaconda/install/).
  * [Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/) is a data science platform which is open-source and supports Windows, macOS, and Linux.
  * It comes with many useful packages such as:
    * scipy,
    * Jupyter Notebook,
    * Spyder.
* If Matplotlib is missing at any reason and it needs to be installed inside Anaconda, run:
```bash
(base) $ conda install matplotlib
```
  * Note you have to go into the virtual environment you wish to use Matploblib.
