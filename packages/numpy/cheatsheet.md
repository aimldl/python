# Numpy Cheat Sheet (TODO)

axes = dimensions

rank = the number of axes

ndarray: n-dimensional array. Numpy's array class

array = ndarray's alias

numpy.array != array.array in the Standard Python Library class

array.array only handles one-dimensional arrays and offers less functionality.

ndarray.ndim = rank or the number of dimensions (axes)
