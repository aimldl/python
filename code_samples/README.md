You're an English teacher. What does it mean by code samples?
```

```
Code samples are small pieces of code that are used to illustrate a particular concept or technique. They can be used in documentation, tutorials, or even as part of a larger code project. Code samples can be written in any programming language, and they can be as simple or complex as needed.

Code samples are a valuable tool for teaching and learning programming. They can help students to understand new concepts and techniques, and they can also provide inspiration for their own coding projects. Code samples can also be used to test new software or to troubleshoot problems.

When writing code samples, it is important to make sure that they are clear and concise. The code should be well-formatted and easy to read, and it should use comments to explain what the code is doing. It is also important to make sure that the code is correct and that it works as expected.

Code samples can be found in a variety of places, including online documentation, tutorials, and code repositories. They can also be created by programmers themselves.
