Exercise 5. List Overlap
https://www.practicepython.org/exercise/2014/03/05/05-list-overlap.html

Take two lists, say for example these two:
  a = [1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, 55, 89]
  b = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13]
and write a program that returns a list that contains only the elements that 
are common between the lists (without duplicates). Make sure your program works
on two lists of different sizes.

Extras:
1. Randomly generate two lists to test this.
2. Write this in one line of Python.
(don’t worry if you can’t figure this out at this point - we’ll get to it soon)
